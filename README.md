# Mobile App for IoT Pill Box

## Problem Statement

Nearly three out of five Americans are prescribed daily medication, however only about half of patients with chronic diseases take their medicine. It can be challenging for health care providers to treat patients effectively, as non-compliance can lead to severe health consequences. It can also be challenging for patients to adhere to instructions due to common deterrents such as medicine costs, illiteracy, long wait times, and depression.

There is a need to lower the barriers for the administration of daily medication. By doing so, the process should be made more transparent for both physicians and patients.

## Proposed Solution

We propose an IoT device that can be used to dispense pills at prescribed intervals throughout the week. The device will interface with a mobile app that both physicians and patients can use to keep track of their weekly progress. Primary care doctors can register patients with a medical code, which the patient can then use to login and access their records.
